# graphql-node-postgres

This is a test GraphQL server created with Postgres and Node.js.  
The actual database URL has been removed for obvious reasons. Before starting the app, add your database URL in models/index.js.

# Start

1. Run `npm i` (or `yarn`) to install all the dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start server.
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/graphiql](http://localhost:3000/graphiql).
